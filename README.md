This repository contains the full source code for my professional academic website, generated on 2025-06-30.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (GitHub Pages)

1. **Create a repository** named `jayadratha-gayen.github.io` on GitHub.
2. **Upload** all files and folders from this ZIP into the root of that repository.
3. Commit and push. GitHub Pages will automatically build and serve the site at `https://jayadratha-gayen.github.io`.
4. *(Optional)* Add a custom domain by creating a `CNAME` file containing your domain and updating DNS.

## ðŸŒ— Day/Night Mode
